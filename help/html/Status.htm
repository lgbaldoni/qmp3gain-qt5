<h3>Status</h3>

<hr>
The two <b>Status 
 bars</b> and the <b>Status line</b> at 
 the bottom of the MP3Gain interface are designed to give you an idea about 
 what MP3Gain is currently doing and how far along a file or batch is during 
 <b>Analysis</b> or <b>Gain</b> 
 operations.

If a single file is being 
 worked on, only the <b>File progress</b> 
 bar will be updated. The <b>Status line</b> will show what MP3Gain 
 is currently doing.

<p>

If several files are being 
 worked on, then both the <b>File progress</b> 
 and <b>Total progress</b> bars will be 
 updated. The 
 <b>Status line</b> will show what MP3Gain 
 is currently doing. In 
 the example below, the current file is 25% finished, while the entire 
 batch of files being processed is 50% finished.
