<h3>Status</h3>

<hr>
The two <b>Status 
 bars</b> and the <b>Status line</b> at 
 the bottom of the QMP3Gain interface are designed to give you an idea about 
 what QMP3Gain is currently doing and how far along a file or batch is during 
 <b>Analysis</b> or <b>Gain</b> 
 operations.

If a single file is being 
 worked on, then both the <b>File progress</b> 
 and <b>Total progress</b> bars will be 
 updated and they always show the same values. The <b>Status line</b> will show what QMP3Gain is currently doing.

If several files are being 
 worked on, then both the <b>File progress</b> 
 and <b>Total progress</b> bars will be updated. The 
 <b>Status line</b> will show what QMP3Gain is currently doing. In 
 the example below, the current file is 29% finished, while the entire 
 batch of files being processed is 82% finished.
