<h3>Modify Gain menu</h3>

<hr>
The <b>Modify Gain</b> menu has the following items, 
which are also available by right-clicking in the file list (<a href="#Popup">note</a>):

<p>

<table>
<col style="width: 33.728%; font-weight: bold;">
<col style="width: 66.272%;">

<tr>
<td>Apply Track Gain <span style="white-space: nowrap">(Ctrl-G)</span></td>
<td>This will volume-correct all files listed in the 
 <a href="File_List.htm">File List</a> to match 
 the <a href="Target_Volume.htm">Target Volume</a>.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Apply Album Gain <span style="white-space: nowrap">(Ctrl-B)</span></td>
<td>This will volume-correct 
 all files listed in the <a href="File_List.htm">File List</a> so that 
 the overall album volume matches the <a href="Target_Volume.htm">Target 
 Volume</a>.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><a name=ConstantGain></a>Apply 
 Constant Gain... <span style="white-space: nowrap">(Ctrl-O)</span></td>
<td>This will launch the <b>Constant Gain</b> dialog.
<p>
<center><img src="ConstantGain.jpg" width=255 height=274></center>
<p>
Here you can specify an 
 absolute gain change in dB instead 
 of a <a href="Target_Volume.htm">Target Volume</a>. Just 
 move the slider until the <b>dB</b> field 
 indicates the amount of gain desired. Increments 
 are in 1.5 dB.
<p>
You can also apply gain to just the right or left channel if the mp3 is stereo or dual-channel. Check 
 the <b>Apply to only one channel</b> 
 box and then choose which channel by clicking the radio button beside 
 the desired channel.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Apply Max No-clip Gain for Each file <span style="white-space: nowrap">(Ctrl-X)</span></td>
<td><i>(Only visible when <a href="Options_menu.htm#Maximizing">Maximizing</a> features are enabled)</i><br>
This will change the gain on each mp3 file so that it is as loud as possible without clipping.
<p>
<i>NOTE</i> - This is <b>not</b> a good way to make all your mp3s the same volume. Different mp3s
can have very different ratios between their <i>maximum</i> amplitude and their <i>average</i>
amplitude.<br>
But if you don't care about volume differences between your mp3s and just want them each to be as
loud as possible, then this is the function to use.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Apply Max No-clip Gain for Album <span style="white-space: nowrap">(Ctrl-L)</span></td>
<td><i>(Only visible when <a href="Options_menu.htm#Maximizing">Maximizing</a> features are enabled)</i><br>
This will look at each folder in the file list, find the single maximum gain which will not cause any
clipping in any of the mp3s in the folder, and then apply that single gain change to all the mp3s in the folder.
<p>
I use this feature myself when burning mix CDs of my mp3s. I copy all the mp3s that will be on the
CD into one folder, do <b>Track Gain</b> on the folder, and then use this function on the folder.
This way, the mp3s are all the same volume, but the whole CD will be as loud as possible without
any of the mp3s clipping.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Undo Gain changes</td>
<td>If <a href="Tags.htm">tags</a> are enabled (i.e. "Options - Tags - Ignore" is <i>not</i> checked), then selecting this menu option will undo all gain changes to the mp3 files in the list</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
<a name="Popup"></a><b>(note)</b> - When you use the right-click popup menu, MP3Gain will only perform the chosen function
on files that are currently selected in the <a href="File_List.htm" >File List</a>.
