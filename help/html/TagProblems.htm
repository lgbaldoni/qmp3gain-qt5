<h3>My tags (&quot;Artist&quot;, &quot;Title&quot;, etc.) are not working after using MP3Gain</h3>

<p>
<hr />
MP3Gain stores &quot;Analysis&quot; and &quot;Undo&quot; information in special tags inside the mp3 file itself. These tags are in the <a href="http://doc.hydrogenaudio.org/wikis/hydrogenaudio/APEv2/wikipage_view" target="_external">APEv2</a> format. APEv2 tags are carefully designed to <b>not</b> interfere with other tag formats, such as the popular <a href="http://www.id3.org/id3v1.html" target="_external">ID3v1</a> format.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, some mp3 players do not strictly adhere to the ID3v1 standard when reading tags. As a result, when MP3Gain writes its APEv2 tags, these mp3 players might get confused and try to read the MP3Gain tags instead of the regular ID3v1 tags such as &quot;Artist&quot;, &quot;Title&quot;, etc. As a result, the player will show random garbage in these fields.
</p>

<p>
(To be fair, the mp3 players that have this problem are actually probably trying to compensate for data corruption that can occur in mp3s due to bad encoders, incomplete downloads, etc.)
</p>

<p>
If you use MP3Gain and discover that your mp3 player has this problem, then here's what you need to do:
<ul>
<li>Select &quot;Options - Tags - Ignore (do not read or write tags)&quot; from the MP3Gain menu. This will prevent MP3Gain from writing any more tags to your files.</li>
<li>To remove tags that MP3Gain has already written, simply load the affected mp3s into MP3Gain and do &quot;Options - Tags - Remove Tags from files&quot;</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>IMPORTANT</b><br />
If you choose the &quot;Options - Tags - Ignore&quot; option, then you will not be able to <i>automatically</i> undo changes made by MP3Gain. You <i>will</i> still be able to undo any changes, but you will have to manually keep track of what changes you make to your files.
