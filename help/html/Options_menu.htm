<h3>Options menu</h3>

<hr>

The <b>Options</b> menu has the following items:

<table>
<col style="width: 33.728%; font-weight: bold;">
<col style="width: 66.272%;">

<tr>
<td>Always on Top</td>
<td>If this option is checked, 
 the QMP3Gain window will always stay on top of other windows.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Work on Selected files only</td>
<td>If this option is checked, 
 then only those files that are currently selected will be operated on if 
 you do an <b>Analysis</b> or <b>Gain</b>.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Add Subfolders</td>
<td>If checked, then when 
 you <b>Add a Folder</b>, all of the mp3s 
 in all of the folders inside the selected folder will be added to the 
 list.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Preserve file date/time</td>
<td>If checked, changed files 
 will keep their original timestamp. If 
 unchecked, file timestamps will change when Gain changes are applied.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>No check for Layer I or II</td>
<td>QMP3Gain will only work on mp3 files. 
On rare occasions, QMP3Gain will mis-identify an mp3 file as an mp2 or mp1 file and refuse to 
do analysis or gain changes on the file.<br>
Enabling this option forces mp3Gain to skip the safety check, 
allowing you to change the gain on these mis-identified files.
<p>
Be careful, though; if you have any mp2 or mp1 files that are accidentally mis-named as mp3 files,
then when you use QMP3Gain to make gain chages on those files, the program will just corrupt the data
in those files.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Don't clip when doing Track Gain</td>
<td>If this is checked, then when you do "Track Gain", if the suggested Track gain will cause clipping then QMP3Gain will apply the maximum non-clipping gain instead</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Tags</td>
<td>
See the <a href="Tags.htm">Tags</a> help page
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Logs</td>
<td>
See the <a href="Logs.htm">Logs</a> help page
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Toolbar</td>
<td>You can modify the look 
 of the toolbar with this item. Available 
 options for the toolbar are:
<p>
Big Buttons<br>
Small Buttons<br>
Text Buttons<br>
No Buttons</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Filename Display</td>
<td>You can select how files 
 are displayed in the <a href="File_List.htm">File List</a>. By 
 default, files are shown with their full path and filename. Available 
 options for the filename display are:
<p>
Show Path/File<br>
Show File only<br>
Show Path &amp; File (as separate columns)</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Minimize to Tray</td>
<td>If this option is checked, then when you minimize the QMP3Gain window it will appear as an
icon in the system tray notification area (the little rectangle in the bottom right corner of
your screen) instead of appearing on your taskbar.<br>
Useful for keeping your taskbar clean while QMP3Gain is working in the background.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Beep when finished</td>
<td>If checked, then QMP3Gain will make a default beep sound when it finishes a task.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Reset Default Column Widths</td>
<td>This option will reset 
 the column positions &amp; sizes to their default settings. Use 
 this if you accidentally hide a column under another, or off the screen.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Resize column widths by content</td>
<td>This option will resize the visible columns of the file list, that each of them has enough width to display its content without line breaking</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Reset &quot;Warning&quot; messages</td>
<td>The first time you perform some actions in QMP3Gain (<b>Clear Analysis</b>, for example),
 the program pops up a dialog box with a warning message. On this dialog box, there's 
 a check box that says <b>Don't ask me again</b>. 
 If you check that box, the program stops showing that particular warning message.
 <p>
Clicking <b>Reset &quot;Warning&quot; Messages</b> makes those 
warning messages start popping up again.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><a name="advanced">Advanced...</a></td>
<td>Advanced options allows 
 you to modify <b>Thread Priority</b> 
 and <b>Performance</b> variables, and allows you to turn on "maximizing" features.</p>
<p>
<center><img src="AdvOptions.jpg"></center>
<p>
<table>
<col style="width: 40.164%; font-weight: bold;">
<col style="width: 59.836%;">

<tr>
<td>Thread Priority</td>
<td>This adjusts what priority 
 the program has in using your computer's resources. If you know what this 
 means, feel free to play with this setting. If you don't know what this 
 means, just leave it alone :) If you see this feature disabled, then it is unsupported yet.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Performance</td>
<td>Checking these boxes might make QMP3Gain run slightly faster on your machine.</td></tr>

<tr>
<a name=Maximizing></a>
<td>Enable &quot;Maximizing&quot; features</td>
<td>"Maximizing" is the word to describe what most audio programs call "normalizing":
finding the maximum amplitude of sound files and setting them to a specified level.<br>
This is <b>not</b> a good way to make audio files sound like they're the same volume.<br>
When you check this box, a message pops up with a link to some files that demonstrate the volume differences
that can remain between songs when you maximize the amplitudes of audio files instead of
volume normalizing.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Extra output log</td>
<td>
Depths of some log output type can be set here.<br/>
<b>Back end log depth</b> sets the log's depth of communication with the MP3Gain back end:<br/>
- 0 value means there is no back end log at all<br/>
- 1 value includes all communication messages except the progress percents<br/>
- 2 value includes all communication<br/>
<b>Trace log depth</b> sets the log's depth of operation of QMP3Gain, it's mostly for possible bug hunting:<br/>
- 0 value means there is no trace log at all<br/>
- 1 value includes all trace messages<br/>
</td>
