Short description:

git clone git://qmp3gain.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/qmp3gain/qmp3gain
qmake qmp3gain.pro
make

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Verbose description:

1. Downloading the source (git client is needed):
git clone git://qmp3gain.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/qmp3gain/qmp3gain

(2. Installing QT SDK (at least v4.5 is required) at http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/
On Windows, after QT installation usually I make a copy of mingw32-make.exe file to make.exe to ease my later hand work, eg.
copy c:\Qt\2009.05\mingw\bin\mingw32-make.exe c:\Qt\2009.05\mingw\bin\make.exe
If you already have a make executable from another developer tool, forget it and use "mingw32-make" instead of "make" later.)

3. Building the application
(On Windows, launch a "Qt command prompt" from the new menu item, and) in the downloaded qmp3gain folder use the following commands:
qmake qmp3gain.pro
make

4. Run the application
After a successful build, run the generated executable file and enjoy it :) Good luck! 
bin/mp3gain(.exe)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Under Windows you may also use "make install" to create a complete installation directory which also includes the all necessary QT runtime libraries:

git clone git://qmp3gain.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/qmp3gain/qmp3gain
qmake -config release -r qmp3gain.pro
make
cd src
qmake -config release src.pro
cd ..
make install

Notes:
	-src.pro file must be qmake-d again, otherwise help and translation files are not copied to the installation directory
	- don't forget to import the backend mp3gain.exe into bin directory before running "make install"
	- check the result in the installation directory (installer/win32/generated), run qmp3gain.nsi script there to create windows installer if you have installed NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) installer maker
