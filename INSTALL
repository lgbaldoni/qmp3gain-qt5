git clone git://qmp3gain.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/qmp3gain/qmp3gain
qmake qmp3gain.pro
make

Verbose description:

1. Downloading the source (git client is needed):
git clone git://qmp3gain.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/qmp3gain/qmp3gain

(2. Installing QT SDK (at least v4.5 is required) at http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/
On Windows, after QT installation usually I make a copy of mingw32-make.exe file to make.exe to ease my later hand work, eg.
copy c:\Qt\2009.05\mingw\bin\mingw32-make.exe c:\Qt\2009.05\mingw\bin\make.exe
If you already have a make executable from another developer tool, forget it and use "mingw32-make" instead of "make" later.)

3. Building the application
(On Windows, launch a "Qt command prompt" from the new menu item, and) in the downloaded qmp3gain folder use the following commands:
qmake qmp3gain.pro
make

4. Run the application
After a successful build, run the generated executable file and enjoy it :) Good luck! 
bin/mp3gain(.exe)
